This repo contains the code for the project assignment of the Coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
It uses the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, of an experiment in the field of wearable computing. See <code>CodeBook.md</code> for more info.

The data set "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" has been downloaded from [UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and stored in the <code>UCI HAR Dataset</code> directory.
The `run_analysis.R` script can be run without any parameters. It collects the data, merges the train and test data sets and creates a clean data set `all_tidy.txt`. This clean data set contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
